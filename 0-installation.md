* Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>

    > The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.
    > Similar to Mathematica notebooks

* Spyder <http://pythonhosted.org/spyder/> (maybe down)
    > Spyder is an interactive Python development environment providing MATLAB-like features in a simple and light-weighted software.
