# What is Python 

From [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm):
> Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.


Python currently has two versions with active development: 2.7 and 3.6. 
Version 3 has some internal code changes that break backwards compatibility with version 2.
However, we do not go into much discussion about this for this workshop. 
Version 2 is the most supported in terms of packages and the most used at the moment.

# For this workshop we use ***Python 2.7***

## Installing Python 2.7


First you should install the correct python package for your operating system.

Most linux distributions already have the base python packages installed.
However, for this workshop we will require additional packages that must be accessible.
* Python 2.7
* NumPy
* SciPy
* pandas 
* matplotlib
* pip

You may install the Python 2.7 through the Anaconda platform, which will also install the required python packages for this workshop.

Please download and install the full **Python 2.7** package in https://www.continuum.io/downloads for your operating system.

***Note:*** Do install the full Anaconda that contains all the relevant packages for this workshop

Also download the `lisbon_temperature.csv` file from [here](data/lisbon_temperature.csv).


Other Python packages

* Python <https://www.python.org/>
    
Other useful platforms can be used around Python:

* IPython <https://ipython.org/>
    > IPython is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language, that offers introspection, rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history

* Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>

    > Anaconda is the leading open data science platform powered by Python. The open source version of Anaconda is a high performance distribution of Python and R and includes over 100 of the most popular Python, R and Scala packages for data science.

* Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>

    > The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.
    > Similar to Mathematica notebooks.

* Spyder <http://pythonhosted.org/spyder/> (maybe down)
    > Spyder is an interactive Python development environment providing MATLAB-like features in a simple and light-weighted software.

* PyPI - the Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>
    > The Python Package Index is a repository of software for the Python programming language.
