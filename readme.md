#  Python workshop


Check the [content](content.md) of this workshop


Have you considered using Python as a tool in your research?
Python is a highly versatile lightweight scripted language that can be used for simple automation, to scientific computing, computer and web applications, laboratory instrument interfacing, hardware communication, and many others.
The vast set of available libraries greatly speeds up development of your code and makes it a serious alternative to popular software such as Matlab.
This workshop explains the basics of Python scripting, data handling and processing and plotting figures for publication.
Which features would you most be interested to learn?

    Dear colleagues,

    We are planning a Python programming workshop at IPFN for anyone willing to attend. 
    We are running a poll to find out which features people are most interested in learning!

    Have you considered using Python as a tool in your research?

    Python is a highly versatile lightweight scripted language that can be used for simple automation, to scientific computing, computer and web applications, laboratory instrument interfacing, hardware communication, and many others.

    The vast set of available libraries greatly speeds up development of your code and makes it a serious alternative to popular software such as Matlab.

    This workshop explains the basics of Python scripting, data handling and processing and plotting figures for publication.

    In addition to the Python workshop, we are also planning another workshop on revision control and collaborative programming using git (https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

    Which features are you most interested in seeing at the workshops?

    About me:
    My name is Diogo Aguiam and I am in the last year of the APPLAuSE PhD programme. I started using Python in 2008 developping scripts for IRC bots and simple web applications. I have used Python in the density profile processing software of a new reflectometry diagnostic for ASDEX Upgrade, as part of my PhD work. Python enabled the quick prototyping of different data analysis algorithms and an overall much faster development of the complete processing software than it would have taken using C.
    Python is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the scientific community and I believe it is a great additional asset any researcher should have.
    I am also an advocate for [Open Science](https://science.mozilla.org/) and aim to share these open and collaborative initiatives with our institute.

    Best regards,
    Diogo Aguiam




We aim to have a series of programming workshops related to Python, open source and collaborative programming, at IPFN for anyone willing to attend.
