#  Python workshop


Check the [content](content.md) of this workshop


Have you considered using Python as a tool in your research?
Python is a highly versatile lightweight scripted language that can be used for simple automation, to scientific computing, computer and web applications, laboratory instrument interfacing, hardware communication, and many others.
The vast set of available libraries greatly speeds up development of your code and makes it a serious alternative to popular software such as Matlab.
This workshop explains the basics of Python scripting, data handling and processing and plotting figures for publication.
Which features would you most be interested to learn?

    Dear colleagues,

    We are planning a Python programming workshop at IPFN for anyone willing to attend. 
    We are running a poll to find out which features people are most interested in learning!

    Have you considered using Python as a tool in your research?

    Python is a highly versatile lightweight scripted language that can be used for simple automation, to scientific computing, computer and web applications, laboratory instrument interfacing, hardware communication, and many others.

    The vast set of available libraries greatly speeds up development of your code and makes it a serious alternative to popular software such as Matlab.

    This workshop explains the basics of Python scripting, data handling and processing and plotting figures for publication.

    In addition to the Python workshop, we are also planning another workshop on revision control and collaborative programming using git (https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

    Which features are you most interested in seeing at the workshops?

    About me:
    My name is Diogo Aguiam and I am in the last year of the APPLAuSE PhD programme. I started using Python in 2008 developping scripts for IRC bots and simple web applications. I have used Python in the density profile processing software of a new reflectometry diagnostic for ASDEX Upgrade, as part of my PhD work. Python enabled the quick prototyping of different data analysis algorithms and an overall much faster development of the complete processing software than it would have taken using C.
    Python is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the scientific community and I believe it is a great additional asset any researcher should have.
    I am also an advocate for [Open Science](https://science.mozilla.org/) and aim to share these open and collaborative initiatives with our institute.

    Best regards,
    Diogo Aguiam




We aim to have a series of programming workshops related to Python, open source and collaborative programming, at IPFN for anyone willing to attend.



Registration email:

    Dear colleagues,

    Thank you very much to everyone who posted to the doodle. We received 37 responses from people interested in attending the workshops!

    We will be doing an Introduction to Python workshop on Thursday, 27th of July 2017, in the North Building, amphitheatre EA3, at Instituto Superior Técnico 

    We will start at 9am with a 4 hour session.
    Depending on how fast the workshop goes, we may have an extra session after lunch, at around 14h30, to continue the workshop or talk about more advanced topics.

    This will be a hands-on live programming session and you are recommended to bring your own laptop with Python 2.7 pre-installed. 
    Please refer to [this link](http://bit.ly/2uM7IWs) for details of installation.

    The workshop will include the basic topics mentioned in the doodle:

    1. Basics of Python programming
    2. Data loading and processing using NumPy
    3. Plotting data with matplotlib

    At the end of the workshop you shall be able to load .csv files, manipulate data, and create figures.

    Please do register until Tuesday, July 24th, for the event at

    http://bit.ly/2vF4YGD

    We will send yet another email to those who register on the eve of the event with the details for the location and time of the workshop.

    Best regards,
    Diogo Aguiam and Luis Guimarãis


Reminder email:
    Dear all,

    Thank you for registering for the Python Workshop. 

    We would like to remind you that the workshop will start at 9 AM tomorrow, Thursday, 27th of July 2017, in the North Building, amphitheatre EA3, at Instituto Superior Técnico.

    This is a hands-on workshop and you should bring your own laptop or pair up with someone else. There are power sockets distributed in the amphitheatre for charging, hopefully they are enough.

    For the workshop you should have python 2.7 installed [see here](http://bit.ly/2uM7IWs) and download the attached "lisbon_temperatures.csv" file to your computer. You may also download the csv file from the installation link.

    We will be in the amphitheatre from 8h30 am. If you have had trouble installing python in your computer, please come early and we will help you out before the workshop.

    See you tomorrow

    Diogo Aguiam and Luis Guimarãis
