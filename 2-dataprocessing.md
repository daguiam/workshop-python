# Data processing with python

In this tutorial we use python load and process some data.
For this, it is necessary to `import` some new modules into python, such as `SciPy` and `NumPy`.

## SciPy - Scientific Computing Tools for Python 
Check more here <https://www.scipy.org/about.html>

> SciPy refers to several related but distinct entities:

> * The SciPy Stack, a collection of open source software for scientific computing in Python, and particularly a specified set of core packages.
> * The community of people who use and develop this stack.
> * Several conferences dedicated to scientific computing in Python - SciPy, EuroSciPy and SciPy.in.
> * The SciPy library, one component of the SciPy stack, providing many numerical routines.


## NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>
> NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
> * a powerful N-dimensional array object
> * sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
> * tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
> * useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

> Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

> NumPy is licensed under the BSD license, enabling reuse with few restrictions.

We show how to load data from `.csv` (comma separated value) files and the 



```python
def function()
